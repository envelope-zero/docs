## General

This describes general behavior of all API endpoints

### Unchanged from v1

- All API responses either have an empty body (only for HTTP 204 responses) or the body consists of only JSON.
- The `error` key always has a value of type `string`, containing a human readable error message. Those error messages are intended to be passed to the user of the application.
- All attributes for a resource are always contained in the objects that the API returns.

### Changed in v2

- API responses are either a list of objects (for collection endpoints) or a single object (for resource endpoints).
- On `POST` endpoints, each object (in the list, if it's a bulk creation endpoint) always has a `data` and an `error` key. If an error ocurred, `error` will contain an error message. If no error occurs, `error` is `null` and `data` contains the created resource.

## Migrating from v1

_All changes are covered in [Changed in v2](#changed-in-v2)_
