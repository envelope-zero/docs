## General

This describes general behavior of all API endpoints

- All API responses either have an empty body (only for HTTP 204 responses) or the body consists of only JSON.
- The `error` key always has a value of type `string`, containing a human readable error message. Those error messages are intended to be passed to the user of the application.
- All attributes for a resource are always contained in the objects that the API returns.
- All API responses have **either** a `data` or an `error` top level key. They canâ€™t appear at the same time.
- The `data` key is either a list of objects (for collection endpoints) or a single object (for resource endpoints).
