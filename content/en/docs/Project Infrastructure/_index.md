  How the Envelope Zero project infrastructure works
---

This page is about how the infrastructure behind the Envelope Zero development is managed, not about how the project itself is developed.

## Website & Domain

The domain `envelope-zero.org` is currently owned by [morre](https://github.com/morremeyer/), one of the project founders. The documentation itself is maintained in https://github.com/envelope-zero/docs and published with GitHub pages.

## Short link service

There is a short link service to enable persistent links to e.g. documentation at https://l.envelope-zero.org, powered by [Shlink](https://shlink.io/) and hosted on infrastructure provided by [morre](https://github.com/morremeyer/).

This is used so that we can move documentation pages around without breaking links in existing software versions for all users.

## GitHub organization

The [Envelope Zero GitHub organization](https://github.com/envelope-zero) is owned and managed by [morre](https://github.com/morremeyer/) and [malfynnction](https://github.com/malfynnction), the project founders.
