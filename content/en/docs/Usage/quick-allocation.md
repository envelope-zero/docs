  How Quick Allocation works
---

Quick allocations enable you to set allocations for all envelopes in one step. Here's what you need to know:

- There are different modes. Select the one most suitable for how you want to budget
- Existing allocations are never overwritten. If an envelope already has money allocated, that is not changed
- No allocations are set for archived envelopes when using quick allocations
