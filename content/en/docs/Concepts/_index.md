Envelope Zero has two core principles. It is a

- zero-based
- envelope

budgeting tool.

## Zero-based budgeting

This means that all available funds are assigned to a purpose.

## Envelope budgeting

This means that funds are assigned to different **envelopes** for different purposes, e.g. groceries, transport, and so on. Spending for that purpose is then taken from that envelope.
